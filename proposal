# Title
Video Game Quiz Maker
## Repository
https://github.com/TrackballTerry/Quiz-Slop

## Description
1-2 sentence description of what it will do and how it relevant to media and digital arts. This program will make an edited mp4 using a collection of folders covering different video game topics, such as "Characters, UI Elements, Skill Trees, Game Logos, Publishers etc...". 
This will help me make video game quiz videos that are random so they are varied and I can play them myself because I didn't make them.

## Features
- Random Selection
	- The program will Import Random to allow for random topics, with random games selected each time.
- Modify Images 
	- The Program will Import Pillow, OS, and Glob to modify the images in the folders for different quiz categories, so if the category is characters it could take a character from a random game and blur them and slowly remove the blur saving them as seperate images to later 
    make into a mp4
- Make an MP4 
	- The Program will take all the edits and put them together into one mp4 using MoviePy 

## Challenges
- Learning the full uses of Pillow for all the edits needed for each category
- With the long length of mp4 and the large amount of edits of images I am temporarily making I will need to learn tricks on optimizing the speed of my code 
- Proper file directory managment, the full program would have a very large amount of images to be differed between and called upon correctly.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome: A program that will fully make an about 10-12 minute random video game quiz video
- The program will make a quiz with 5 categories, 10 questions per category that are chosen at random. This would include timers showing how much time is left for each question, and the answers.

Minimal Viable Outcome: A program that can makes an about 10-12 minute mostly random video game quiz video that may require a bit of additional editing before being uploadable.
- The program will make edits for the same 5 categories each time with 10 random questions. 

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Working randomized Category Selection, working randomized image selection without actually doing anything with the images.
  2. Begin sourcing the images needed for the minimum viable outcome 5 categories. We'll do "Characters, Game Logos, Ui Elements, Covers, Maps".

- Week 2
  1. Make the character blur effect, This can be applied for the character questions and Cover questions maybe others with just different intensities of blur effect which can be take the specification when the blur function is called.
  2. Learn how to add the timer effect to each question. First thought is to add the timer to each image based on a frame count so every 24 frames would be 1 second.

- Week 3 
  1. Take all the slected and edited images and convert them into one mp4 or a bunch of mp4 one for each category?
  2. Start Collecting Images for other categories outside of the 5 minimum categories

- Week 4 (Final)
  1. Add in more categories to the program.
  2. Add an intro and outro template to put at the start and end of the mp4?
